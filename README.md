# YelpCamp
Finally added this project to git, developing it on C9 at the moment.

Website with a landing page leading to a list of campgrounds. Selecting any campground will show details on that campground, and any comments users have added to it. Users can register and log in which will give them access to adding campgrounds and comments, and updating or deleting their own campgrounds and comments.
